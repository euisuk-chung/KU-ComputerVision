# Assignment
## Task 1 : Rendering a Lambertian sphere
- We want to create a picture of a shaded sphere, which means we need to first define a spherical surface.
  - Assuming that it has a radius of r=60

## Task 2 : Writing a renderer
- Write a simple software renderer that will transform an objectâ€™s 3D coordinates into a 2D picture that is viewed from a camera floating in space.
